# Thera Bank - Customer Credit Card Churn Prevention

### MSAAI-510-02-SU23-Final-Project-TEAM1

Thera Bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of customers using their bank approved credit cards. The bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services, so that it can improve upon those areas.
Building a machine learning classification model will be the best approach because it will allow the bank to analyze its customer data and identify the features that make up the customers who will leave their credit card services. Classification models are used to classify target dataset based on the features provided.
